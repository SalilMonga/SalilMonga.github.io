# Portfolio Project

A [simple portfolio website](https://salil-monga-github-io.vercel.app/) to help me continue to explore what I have learned and new tech that is being released. This project is open to everyone, if you want to learn something and collaborate with me you are welcome to send me a message. This is a continuous development project and I will aim to keep on learning and evolving design elements. It will also include best coding practices and AGILE methodology.
