# Portfolio Project

A [simple portfolio website](https://salil-monga-github-io.vercel.app/) to help me continue explore what I have learnt and new tech that is being released. This project is open to everyone, if you want to learn something and collaborate with me you are welcome to send me a message. This is a continuous development project and my aim will be to keep on learning and evolving design elements. It will also include best coding practices and AGILE methodology.
